## Project Description

This app helps users schedule chores for children and manage the amount of money each child earned from the chores they have done throughout the week. You can add parents, children, and chores, and assign chores to a child on a specific day of the week. After a chore is done, you can mark it as completed, making it easy to see which chores have been done on the Home page. You are also allowed to edit or delete chores, parents, and children from detail pages. When creating a chore, you can set the amount of money a child will earn along with the title and description of the chore.
On the child detail page, you can find both the number of chores the child has done so far and the total amount that the child has earned. It also has a feature where you can choose a background color for a chore assigned to the child. Every time you assign a chore to a child, the chore will be displayed with the chosen color as a background, which is useful especially when managing multiple children.
